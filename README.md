# Recette
Easy to use receipe editor in your browser.

## Goals
Have a what-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG) editor for basic HTML, to write receipes fast.
Recette will be built with vue.js for its ease of development and the ability to use web components.
The goal for Recette is to be able to type only the steps of your receipe and the software detects the ingredients and automatically converts between units to give a pertinent list of ingredients on the side and only need to adjust it a little.

## Why should I use it over Google Docs or any other text editor ?
First, Recette is open-source. You can trust any part of this code because you can read it !
Second, it's build to write receipes ! This is a more specialized tool than say LibreOffice and therefore has inherent benefits, such as the live ingredients list.
Third, the consistency of a web-based editor that will work on any OS, that is lightweight and look the same no matter on which computed you use it.

## The .recette file format
The save format is a zip file that contains the different resources of your receipe (text, formatting, ingredients, images...)
This format is subect to change during the development of the project.

## Who is doing it ?
Anyone ! Recette is free and open-source, which means that the goal is to make Recette offline-first and allow you to have a free and easy to use software without any useless clutter.
As of the time I'm writing this, Geoffrey Coulaud (It's me !) is the maintainer and only contributor.

## Short term goals
- Text editor with basic text support (bold, italic, titles, color...)
- Manual ingredients list
- Units conversion
- Volumic mass of common ingredients for easy conversion between mass and volume
- Dynamic ingredients list

## Long term goals
- Cloud services support for backups of your precious receipes (e.g. import to your Google Drive or Dropbox)
